MNDOT2ArcMap
============

### Extract live Minneapolis traffic station data and plot it directly into Arcmap

##### This tool requires 2 things:
 1. [Xml2CSV-conv](https://code.google.com/p/xml2csv-conv/) (append to PATH or keep within mndot2arcmap directory)
 2. And of course, ArcGIS

##### To use this script:
  1. Create an mxd with the file StationPoints feature class as a layer within your dataview
  2. Import the script test.py (No parameters nessessary)
  3. Run it
  
##### Data for this project consists of MNDOT [IRIS_XML](http://data.dot.state.mn.us/iris_xml/) data services
